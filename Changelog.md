# Changelog

## V0.1.3

- Remove brackets around coordinate announcements, so `x, y` instead of `(x, y)`. This shortens speech when the screen reader is configured to announce more punctuation
- Tab and shift+tab now wrap for convenience. A sound is played to indicate when this happens
- When focus is not on the grid in the adventure map or combat screens, pressing escape now moves focus back to the grid
- Enemy wielders moving outside your view range will no longer be announced, woops
- Teleports are now announced as teleports instead of move. The accessibility cursor also follows the wielder to the teleport destination
- Teleports and movement events from wielders that don't belong to you are now saved to the notifications buffer

## V0.1.2

This is an emergency release because I left out a critical config file, so this wasn't working for anyone else. Woops.

## V0.1.1

- Fixed regression that broke support for popup dialogs
- Make the claim menu accessible. This screen appears when interacting with an enemy settlement
- Fix notifications widget in adventure map HUD not appearing even when there were notifications to display

## V0.1.0

Initial release
